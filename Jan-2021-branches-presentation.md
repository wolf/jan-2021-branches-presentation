    * Terminology
        * HEAD is where you're at right now
        * 'the tip' of the branch, and the branch name itself both refer to the newest commit on the branch
        * Usually `HEAD` and the tip of the branch refer to the same commit

* Things IntelliJ does for you
    * you can just start typing in the branch menu (any branch menu)
        * and you can start typing into the menu that pops up _out_ of a branch, too
    * Saves and restores your workspace when you switch branches

* Do I want to talk about detached heads?
